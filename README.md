# pokebrbot
This is a bot for telegram, with a pokemon game, meant to be played on groupchats.
The project was made with the purpose of learning python.

When the bot is running, it allows users to play a competitive battle pokemon game, using the telegram chat app.

This project has really bad design, but it was my first project, so I think it is interesting to look back and see how much I have improved.
